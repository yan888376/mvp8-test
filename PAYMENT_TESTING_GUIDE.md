## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to start checkout. Please try again."
**Cause**: API credentials are incorrect or expired

**Cause**: PayPal auto-detects your location/IP
**Solution**: You can change language at the bottom of PayPal page (e.g., Swedish → English)

### Issue: Stripe checkout page doesn't load
**Cause**: Invalid Stripe API key or network issue
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, verify Stripe keys

### Issue: Email field is required
**Cause**: Payment requires user email for receipts
**Solution**: Enter a valid email address before payment
